Mr-Voxel is licensed under a modified MIT license. The MIT license itself
is unchanged, we have only added an optional beerware clause. That is
to say, you have the option of completely disregarding the beerware clause
and using Mr-Voxel under the vanilla MIT license if you so wish.

Optional beerware clause:
If we happen to meet in person someday and you think this software is worth
it, you are welcome to buy us a round of beers. This clause is entirely
optional, and need not be fulfilled for you to fully comply with the terms
of this license.

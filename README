Mr-Voxel is a combination of an accelerated voxel data-structure and volume
rendering library.  Long term goals involve including importance-sampled 
light caches for all polygonal, implicit and volume objects in a scene.

This is the culmination of research and design surrounding my graphics graduate
thesis.  It is important to note that, while I may have a fully fledged volume 
renderer, that is not the focus of my thesis.  It is also important to note 
that many of the lighting equations specific to my volume rendering process are
derived or loosely based off of the volume rendering sections of "Physically 
Based Rendering, 2nd edition" by Matt Pharr. http://pharr.org/matt/ .  Thank 
you, Matt, for indirectly helping me so much through the course of my work 
through your book!

Mr-Voxel is licensed under a modified MIT license. Don't worry, the modifications
are minimal. See the LICENSE file for details.

Until my thesis work is complete (June 2011) the code is open source,
but I am not taking outside contributions to the project. After that,
I may start taking community input at my discretion. It depends.
